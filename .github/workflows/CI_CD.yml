# --- PIPELINE SUMMARY ---
# 1. Trigger: Runs automatically on a push to the 'main' branch or manually via workflow_dispatch.
# 2. Build & Test: Checks out code, sets up .NET, restores, and builds the project.
#    Installs Playwright dependencies and runs all Unit, Integration, and E2E tests. 
#    If any test fails, the pipeline halts immediately to protect the production server.
# 3. Docker Image: If tests pass, it logs into Docker Hub, builds a new image using the GitHub run 
#    number as a tag (e.g., :45), and pushes it to the registry.
# 4. Deployment: Connects to the DigitalOcean droplet via SSH, pulls the new image, and swaps containers.
#    It mounts a Managed Docker Volume and passes the DB path as an environment variable so the 
#    simulator's registered users and cheeps survive the deployment.
